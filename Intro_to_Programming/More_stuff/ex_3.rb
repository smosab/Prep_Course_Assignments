# exception handling is a programming method used to manage
# or "handle" exceptions or "errors" that are displayed
# to a user after a bug or error has occured in the execution
# of a program.

# Exception handling solves the problem of a program exiting
# an execution pre-maturely and allowing for a more friendlier
# user message.
