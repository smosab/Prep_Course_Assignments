  # The '!' mark is a modifier. It mutates the caller
  # The '?' evaluates a statement and returns a boolean (true or false)

  #  1)
  # '!=' means 'not equal to' and is used to evaluate a statement and for iterations or as a condition in loops

  # 2)
  # '!' before something returns the opposite boolean. So !user_name would return false.

  # 3)
  # '!' after something usualy modifies the object permanantly.

  # 4)
  # '?' before something returns the value of the object

  # 5)
  # '?' after usually means evaluate the paramater being passed in to determine if it exists or not.

  # 6)
  # not sure about this one, but my guess is it is the opposite result of !user_name.
